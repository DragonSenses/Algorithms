 * associated with some element e in a list L, does not change,
 * even if the index of e changes in L due to insertions or
 * deletions elsewhere in the list. The only way in which a
 * position is invalid is if that position is removed. Even when
 * we replace the element e stored at p with another element, p
 * does not change. This allows a position type that serves as
 * parameters to some methods and returns values from other
 * methods of a list
