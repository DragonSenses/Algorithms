/**
 * The Fibonacci series, is a series of numbers in which each number
 * (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
 * 
 * Fn = {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 
 *      34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987....}
 * Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
 * 
 * If one were to draw a line starting in the right bottom corner of
 * a golden rectangle within the first square and then touch each 
 * succeeding multiple squares outside corners, you would create a 
 * Fibonacci spiral.
 * 
 * The beauty in this sequence is how it represents structures and 
 * sequences that model physical reality, as it appears in the 
 * smallest to the largest objects in Nature. From petals,
 * rows of seeds, chicken eggs, nautilus shells, and even spirals.
 * 
 * The Fibonacci sequence is a way for information to flow in a very 
 * efficient manner.
