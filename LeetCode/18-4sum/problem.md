# Solution
- [Two Pointers Approach](#two-pointers)

## 4Sum Problem Overview

### Follow-Up of 3Sum

4Sum and 3Sum are very similar; the difference is that we are looking for unique quadruplets instead of triplets.

### Wrapping Two Sum

3Sum essentially wraps Two Sum in an outer loop. As it iterates through each value `v`, it finds all pairs whose sum is equal to `target - v` using one of these approaches:
1. **Two Sum**: Uses a hash set to check for a matching value.
2. **Two Sum II**: Uses the two-pointers pattern in a sorted array.

### Extending to 4Sum

Following a similar logic, we can implement 4Sum by wrapping 3Sum in another loop.

### Generalizing to kSum

If asked to solve 4Sum, the interviewer might follow up with 5Sum, 6Sum, and so on. What they really expect is a `kSum` solution. Therefore, we will focus on a generalized implementation here.

# Two Pointers

## **Intuition**

The two pointers pattern requires the array to be sorted, so we do that first. Also, it's easier to deal with duplicates if the array is sorted: repeated values are next to each other and easy to skip.

For 3Sum, we enumerate each value in a single loop, and use the two pointers pattern for the rest of the array. For kSum, we will have `k - 2` nested loops to enumerate all combinations of `k - 2` values.

### Key Concept

The kSum problem can be generalized from the 2Sum and 3Sum problems. By understanding the pattern and extending it, we can create a solution that works for any kSum.

### Wrapping Two Sum

For the 3Sum problem, we wrap Two Sum in an outer loop. As we iterate through each value `v`, we find all pairs whose sum is equal to `target - v`. We can use:
1. **Two Sum with Hash Set**: Use a hash set to check for matching values.
2. **Two Sum II with Two Pointers**: Use the two-pointers technique in a sorted array.

### Generalizing to kSum

Following a similar logic, we can implement 4Sum by wrapping 3Sum in another loop. When asked for higher sums like 5Sum, 6Sum, etc., the interviewer expects a generalized kSum solution. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the result list.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the input array `nums`.
3. **Recursive kSum Function**:
   - **Base Case**: If k equals 2, use the Two Sum approach.
   - **Recursive Case**: Iterate through the array, fixing one number and recursively finding the (k-1)Sum.
4. **Return the Results**: Collect and return the results from the recursive calls.

### Example and Walkthrough

**Input**: `nums = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2]`, `target = 0`

1. **Initialization**:
   - Result list: `[]`
2. **Sorting**:
   - Sorted `nums`: `[-2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2]`
3. **Recursive Calls**:
   - **4Sum**: Iterate with the first number, then call 3Sum with the remaining array.
   - **3Sum**: Fix the second number, then call 2Sum.
   - **2Sum**: Use two pointers to find pairs that match the target.

## **Algorithm**

We can implement `k-2` loops using recursion. We will pass the starting point and `k` as the parameters. When `k == 2`, we will call `twoSum`, terminating the recursion.

### Main Function

1. **Sort the Input Array**:
   - Sort the input array `nums`.
2. **Call kSum**:
   - Call `kSum` with `start = 0`, `k = 4`, and `target`, and return the result.

### kSum Function

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - At the start of the `kSum` function, check three conditions:
     1. Have we run out of numbers to choose from?
     2. Is the smallest number remaining greater than `target / k`?
        - If so, then any `k` numbers we choose will be too large.
     3. Is the largest number remaining smaller than `target / k`?
        - If so, then any `k` numbers we choose will be too small.
   - If any of these conditions are true, there is no need to continue as no combination of the remaining elements can sum to `target`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If `k` equals 2, call `twoSum` and return the result.

3. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Iterate `i` through the array from `start`:
     1. If the current value is the same as the one before, skip it.
     2. Recursively call `kSum` with `start = i + 1`, `k = k - 1`, and `target - nums[i]`.
     3. For each returned subset of values:
        - Include the current value `nums[i]` into the subset.
        - Add the subset to the result `res`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the result `res`.

### twoSum Function

1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - Set the low pointer `lo` to `start`, and high pointer `hi` to the last index.

2. **While Loop**:
   - While the low pointer is smaller than high:
     1. If the sum of `nums[lo]` and `nums[hi]` is less than `target`, increment `lo`.
        - Also increment `lo` if the value is the same as for `lo - 1`.
     2. If the sum is greater than `target`, decrement `hi`.
        - Also decrement `hi` if the value is the same as for `hi + 1`.
     3. Otherwise, we found a pair:
        - Add it to the result `res`.
        - Decrement `hi` and increment `lo`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the result `res`.

## **Implementation**

**Note:** Handle the folowing edge cases:
  - Large Numbers
  - Negative Targets
