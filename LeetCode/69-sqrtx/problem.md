## Problem Overview

### Given Problem
You are given a non-negative integer \( x \). Your task is to return the square root of \( x \) rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative. 

### Restrictions
- You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator. For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in C++ or `x ** 0.5` in Python.

### Examples
- **Example 1**:
    - Input: \( x = 4 \)
    - Output: \( 2 \)
    - Explanation: The square root of \( 4 \) is \( 2 \), so we return \( 2 \).

- **Example 2**:
    - Input: \( x = 8 \)
    - Output: \( 2 \)
    - Explanation: The square root of \( 8 \) is approximately \( 2.82842... \), and since we round it down to the nearest integer, \( 2 \) is returned.

### Additional Context
The value \( a \) we're supposed to compute could be defined as:
\[ a^2 \leq x < (a+1)^2 \]
This value is called the *integer square root*. 

#### Geometrical Interpretation
From a geometrical perspective, it represents the side of the largest integer-sided square with an area less than or equal to \( x \).

![When x = 10, we find the integer square root using the the candidates 4, 9, and 16](img/69-1.jpg)

Let's explore the relationship between 4, 9, and 16 when looking for the integer square root of \( x = 10 \).

The integer square root of \( x \) is the largest integer \( a \) such that \( a^2 \leq x \). For \( x = 10 \):

1. **4**: \( 2^2 = 4 \). This is less than 10, so \( 2 \) is a possible candidate.
2. **9**: \( 3^2 = 9 \). This is also less than 10, so \( 3 \) is another candidate.
3. **16**: \( 4^2 = 16 \). This is greater than 10, so \( 4 \) is not a candidate.

The largest integer whose square is less than or equal to 10 is \( 3 \). However, we are looking for the integer part of the square root, rounded down. The square root of 10 is approximately \( 3.162 \), and rounding down gives us \( 3 \).

So, the integer square root of \( x = 10 \) is \( 3 \).

Here's the relationship in summary:
- 4: \( 2^2 \)
- 9: \( 3^2 \)
- 16: \( 4^2 \)

Since 10 lies between 9 and 16, the integer square root is the one corresponding to \( 3 \). 

### Algorithm Insight
To solve this problem, you can use a binary search algorithm, which efficiently finds the integer square root by narrowing down the possible values. Here's a brief outline of how it works:
1. Initialize two pointers: `left` and `right`. `left` starts at \( 0 \) and `right` starts at \( x \).
2. Perform a binary search:
    - Calculate the midpoint `mid`.
    - If `mid * mid` is equal to \( x \), return `mid`.
    - If `mid * mid` is less than \( x \), move `left` to `mid + 1`.
    - Otherwise, move `right` to `mid - 1`.
3. The loop continues until `left` is greater than `right`.
4. The integer square root is `right` at the end of the search.

This method ensures that you find the largest integer `a` such that \( a^2 \leq x \).

# Pocket Calculator Algorithm Approach

## **Intuition**

Pocket calculators often compute exponential functions and natural logarithms efficiently by using precomputed logarithm tables or other methods. To find the square root of a number, we can leverage these capabilities by reducing the problem to a combination of exponential and logarithmic functions.

The mathematical relationship we use is:
\[ \sqrt{x} = e^{(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \log x)} \]

Although this method isn't simple or basic, it is very practical and works similarly to how real-world calculators perform these calculations.

## **Algorithm**

1. **Input**: A non-negative integer \( x \).
2. **Special Case**: If \( x \) is 0, return 0 immediately since the square root of 0 is 0.
3. **Compute the Natural Logarithm**: Calculate the natural logarithm (\( \log x \)) of \( x \).
4. **Scale the Logarithm**: Multiply the natural logarithm by 0.5.
5. **Compute the Exponential Function**: Calculate the exponential function \( e \) raised to the power of the scaled logarithm (\( e^{(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \log x)} \)).
6. **Round Down**: Since we need the integer part of the result, round down the computed value to the nearest integer.
7. **Return the Result**: Output the result as the integer square root of \( x \).

### **Pseudocode**

```plaintext
function integerSquareRoot(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    
    // Step 3: Compute the natural logarithm of x
    logX = log(x)
    
    // Step 4: Scale the logarithm by 0.5
    halfLogX = 0.5 * logX
    
    // Step 5: Compute the exponential function
    sqrtX = exp(halfLogX)
    
    // Step 6: Round down to the nearest integer
    result = floor(sqrtX)
    
    return result
```

### Note on Implementation

- The functions `log(x)` and `exp(x)` represent the natural logarithm and exponential functions, respectively.
- The function `floor(x)` rounds down \( x \) to the nearest integer.

By following this approach, you can leverage the efficiency of logarithmic and exponential computations to find the integer square root of \( x \).

## **Implementation**

### Java

```java
class Solution {

  // Returns the integer square root of x, rounded down to the nearest integer.
  public int mySqrt(int x) {
    // Special case: If x is 0 or 1, return x as the square root is the number itself.
    if (x < 2) {
      return x;
    }

    // Compute the approximate square root using the pocket calculator algorithm:
    // sqrt(x) â‰ˆ e^(0.5 * log(x))
    int left = (int) Math.pow(Math.E, 0.5 * Math.log(x));

    // Adjust the result by checking the next integer to ensure proper rounding down
    int right = left + 1;

    // Return the correct integer square root
    return (long) right * right > x ? left : right;
  }
}
```
