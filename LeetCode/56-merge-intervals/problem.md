# 56. Merge Intervals

<p>Given an array&nbsp;of <code>intervals</code>&nbsp;where <code>intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code>, merge all overlapping intervals, and return <em>an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[1,5]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

<ul>
  <li><code>1 &lt;= intervals.length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>

### Problem Overview: Merge Intervals

The problem you're looking into is "Merge Intervals." Hereâ€™s an overview of it:

### Problem Description:
Given an array of intervals where each interval is represented as `[start_i, end_i]`, your task is to merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
- **Output:** `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
- **Explanation:** Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,6]`.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`
- **Output:** `[[1,5]]`
- **Explanation:** Intervals `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping and are merged into `[1,5]`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- Each interval has exactly two elements.
- `0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^4`

### Approach:
To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:
1. **Sort the intervals** based on their start values.
2. **Initialize an empty list** to hold the merged intervals.
3. **Iterate through the sorted intervals**:
    - If the list of merged intervals is empty, or the current interval does not overlap with the previous one, simply append it.
    - If the current interval does overlap with the previous one, merge them by updating the end value of the previous interval.
4. Return the merged intervals.
