### Problem Overview: Merge Intervals

The problem you're looking into is "Merge Intervals." Hereâ€™s an overview of it:

### Problem Description:
Given an array of intervals where each interval is represented as `[start_i, end_i]`, your task is to merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
- **Output:** `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
- **Explanation:** Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,6]`.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`
- **Output:** `[[1,5]]`
- **Explanation:** Intervals `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping and are merged into `[1,5]`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- Each interval has exactly two elements.
- `0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^4`

### Approach:
To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:
1. **Sort the intervals** based on their start values.
2. **Initialize an empty list** to hold the merged intervals.
3. **Iterate through the sorted intervals**:
    - If the list of merged intervals is empty, or the current interval does not overlap with the previous one, simply append it.
    - If the current interval does overlap with the previous one, merge them by updating the end value of the previous interval.
4. Return the merged intervals.

# Sorting Approach

## **Intuition**

If we sort the intervals by their start value, then each set of intervals that can be merged will appear as a contiguous "run" in the sorted list.

First, we sort the list as described. Then, we insert the first interval into our merged list and continue considering each interval in turn as follows:
- If the current interval begins after the previous interval ends, then they do not overlap, and we can append the current interval to the merged list.
- Otherwise, they do overlap, and we merge them by updating the end of the previous interval if it is less than the end of the current interval.

A simple proof by contradiction shows that this algorithm always produces the correct answer. First, suppose that the algorithm at some point fails to merge two intervals that should be merged. This would imply that there exists some triple of indices \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) in a list of intervals \(\text{ints}\) such that \(i < j < k\) and \((\text{ints}[i], \text{ints}[k])\) can be merged, but neither \((\text{ints}[i], \text{ints}[j])\) nor \((\text{ints}[j], \text{ints}[k])\) can be merged. From this scenario follow several inequalities:

\[
\text{ints}[i].\text{end} < \text{ints}[j].\text{start}
\]
\[
\text{ints}[j].\text{end} < \text{ints}[k].\text{start}
\]
\[
\text{ints}[i].\text{end} \geq \text{ints}[k].\text{start}
\]

We can chain these inequalities (along with the following inequality, implied by the well-formedness of the intervals: \(\text{ints}[j].\text{start} \leq \text{ints}[j].\text{end}\)) to demonstrate a contradiction:

\[
\text{ints}[i].\text{end} < \text{ints}[j].\text{start} \leq \text{ints}[j].\text{end} < \text{ints}[k].\text{start}
\]
\[
\text{ints}[i].\text{end} \geq \text{ints}[k].\text{start}
\]

Therefore, all mergeable intervals must occur in a contiguous run of the sorted list.

Consider the example below, where the intervals are sorted, and then all mergeable intervals form contiguous blocks:
\[
\{(1, 9), (2, 5), (19, 20), (10, 11), (12, 20), (0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 2)\}
\]
Sorted:
\[
\{(0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 9), (2, 5), (10, 11), (12, 20), (19, 20)\}
\]

## **Algorithm**

1. **Sort** the intervals based on their start values.
2. **Initialize** an empty list to hold the merged intervals.
3. **Iterate** through the sorted intervals:
    - If the list of merged intervals is empty, or the current interval does not overlap with the previous one, append it.
    - If the current interval does overlap with the previous one, merge them by updating the end value of the previous interval.
4. **Return** the merged intervals.
